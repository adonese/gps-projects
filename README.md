# gps-projects
This repository is dedicated to my GPS computations algorithms. I wish I'll keep updating it until it becomes a good toolbox that I can upload to Matlab fileexchange as open source project. 

PS: This is the very first version, it's not even tested yet don't expect fine results though.
